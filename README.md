ChatAI using Gemini API

A responsive and interactive front-end project built using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**, with the UI designed in **Figma**.

Description:

This project is a experiment with integrating Google's Gemini API to stimulate an intelligent assistant in a web environment. I had several challenges while developing this-from understanding API request/response pattterns to aliging the front-end interactions.

Features:
  1. Real-Time AI Response using Gemini API
  2. Minimal UI designed.
  3. Built with vanilla CSS and Javascript (no frameworks used);
  4. Responsive Layout.
